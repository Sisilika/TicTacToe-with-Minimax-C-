# TicTacToe-with-Minimax-C++

General computer generated TicTacToe generates moves at random. Same old boring, unintelligent next moves by the bot. But what if we make the game more interesting? What if we can make the bot or the opposite player, that is the computer, think before the next move? What if we make it intelligent artificially? 

That would be fantastic, isnt it. So this program uses Minimax AI algorithm so that the opponent (system) can think and generate the next move to make it more challenging to the player. Writing it in basic C++ code makes it even more familiar and enthralling.

So therefore here is the C++ code for our same old TicTacToe game but using Minimax Algo, just a lil taste of AI. This code can be used in any C++ IDE, copy the code, compile it and run it. There you go, go ahead to check it out.
